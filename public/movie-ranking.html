<h1>The Best Movies According to Candice</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Exorcist</h3>
<p>This movie just turned 50 years old a few days ago, but it is a horror classic that is definitely worth watching.</p>
<h3>O Brother Where Art Thou</h3>
<p> This is a cult classic by the Coen Brothers starring George Clooney that is a modern retelling of The Odyssey by Homer reimaged in the Dust Bowl of the American Deep South in the 1930s. The soundtrack alone is enough reason to watch.</p>
<h3>Aliens</h3>
<p>An incredible sequel by James Cameron that stars Sigourney Weaver as a woman who has survived an alien infestation that killed her entire crew and has been lost out in space ever since. Now that she's been discovered, they ask her to go back and help fight the aliens again. It might sound derivative of the first movie, but the sequel is actually the stronger of the two films. </p>
